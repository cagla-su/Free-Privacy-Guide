# Completely Free Privacy Guide
- Hello. In this guide, you will be informed about **how to be more private** while using your **computer(s) and mobile device(s)**.
- **100%** privacy requires payment. This guide aims to show you **completely free** ways for better privacy, which means you **will not be 100% private** following this guide. However, it surely will help you become more private.
- If you are ready, let's begin!
## For Computers
- For privacy on computers, I suggest that you use **Linux**. Linux distributions **respect your privacy** and they are **free**.
  - Linux does enough for **daily driving** and **gaming**. If your concern about switching to Linux is it being not good enough for gaming, you can check [my Linux Gaming Guide](https://github.com/cagla-su/Linux-Gaming-Guide) to feel satisfied about it.
- For **MacOS** and **Windows**:
  - If you are using **MacOS**, you can apply the basic steps [explained in this article](https://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/en/resources/data_privacy/device-privacy-tips/How-Protect-Privacy-Mac.html).
  - If you are using **Windows**, you can use [Chris Titus' Windows Utility](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil), the utility tool also has nice options that increase performance.
## For Mobile Devices
- If you are using an **iOS** device, you can [follow this guide](https://github.com/iPrivacyGuides/iOS-Privacy-Guide)
- If you are using an **Android** device, I definitely suggest you install a **custom ROM**.
  - However if you do not want to install a custom ROM, you can basically [follow this guide](https://veepn.com/blog/10-android-privacy-settings/) and skip this step. If you decided to use a custom ROM, keep reading the step.
    - Custom ROMs are generally more private because they are more barebone compared to stock ROMs. Especially if you are using a vanilla custom ROM, which means a custom ROM with no Google services, you are more private.
    - If you use a vanilla custom ROM, you are going to need Google services for features such as **location, push notifications, play integrity etc.** and in this case, there is a more private open source alternative! It is called **MicroG**.
      - MicroG is an **open source re-implementation of Google services and libraries** that respects your privacy and consumes **less resources** compared to **Google services and libraries** which grants **better battery life and privacy**. For further information, you can check [my MicroG Guide](https://github.com/cutiepenguins/MicroG-Guide).
    - After installing MicroG, that is all you could do for an Android experience with better privacy.
## Other Methods (Regardless of Operating Systems)
- **Using a Private DNS:** My suggestion is using either [WARP](https://one.one.one.one/) or [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)
- **Using a VPN:** Free VPNs do not provide **enough privacy**, however [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) is an exception. You can use it comfortably.
- **Using an E-Mail Client:**. My suggestion is using [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/).
- **Using a 2FA (Two Factor Authenticator):** My suggestion is using [Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/), it is **open source and free**.
- **Using an Ad Blocker:** If you are using **Android**, I suggest that you use [AdAway](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.adaway/). For your **web browser**, [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is the only viable option.
  - However if you are using a **Chromium based** browser such as Chrome, Edge, Arc etc. installing an ad blocker from **Google Web Store** will not work! You should either use [uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh) or a **Firefox based** browser for full functionality. For further information, visit [uBlock Origin Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/wiki/index/).
