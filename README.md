# Completely Free Privacy Guide
- Hello ü§≠. In this guide, you will be informed about **better privacy** while using your **computer** or **mobile devices**.
- Nowadays, most of the companies such as **Microsoft** and **Google** collect **too much** personal information, so you might want to have more privacy while using your devices.
- **100%** privacy requires payments. This guide aims to show you **completely free** ways for better privacy, which means you **will not be 100% private** following this guide. However, it surely will help you become more private.
- So, let's begin!
## For Computers
- For privacy on computers, I suggest you use **Linux**. Linux distributions **respect your privacy** and they are **free**.
  - Linux is pretty much enough for **daily driving** and **gaming**. If your concern about switching to Linux is it being not good enough for gaming, you can check my [Linux Gaming Guide](https://github.com/cutiepenguins/Linux-Gaming-Guide) to feel satisfied about it.
- However, you might not want to get out of your comfort zone. In this case:
  - If you are using **MacOS**, you can apply the basic steps [explained in this article](https://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/en/resources/data_privacy/device-privacy-tips/How-Protect-Privacy-Mac.html).
  - If you are using **Windows**, you can use [Chris Titus' Windows Utility](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil), the utility also has cool features that increase performance.
## For Mobile Devices
- If you are using an **iOS** device, you can [follow this guide](https://github.com/iPrivacyGuides/iOS-Privacy-Guide)
- If you are using an **Android** device, I definitely suggest you install a **custom ROM**.
  - However if you do not want to install a custom ROM, you can basically [follow this guide](https://veepn.com/blog/10-android-privacy-settings/) and skip this step. If you decided to use a custom ROM, keep reading the step.
    - There are different kinds of custom roms. Those are:
      - `AOSP` - **Android Open Source Project :** This is the barebone Android that Google shares the source code of. Those ROMs are generally lightweight. Some AOSP based ROM examples are:
        - `LineageOS`
        - `CrDroid`
        - `ArrowOS`
      - `CAF` - **Code Aurora Forum :** CAF ROMs are also **AOSP based** but they have specific optimizations for **Qualcomm devices (Snapdragon CPUs)** that deliver **smoothness, better performance, better RAM management** and **better battery life**. Some CAF based ROM examples are:
        - `Paranoid Android`
        - `ReloadedOS`
    - My personal suggestion is **CrDroid** since it is **not too barebone**, which means it does not need additional configuration, and it has **highly customizable tools** with **some of the CAF optimizations**. Assuming you installed CrDroid, let's continue.
    - CrDroid and all other **Vanilla** custom ROMs do not have **Google Play Services and Libraries** installed which means you are **unable** to use **location services, google play applications and push notifications**. That is why, I suggest you use **MicroG**. You can check [my MicroG Guide](https://github.com/cutiepenguins/MicroG-Guide) if you're interested.
      - After installing MicroG, that is all you could do for an android experience with better privacy.
## Other Methods (Regardless of Operating Systems)
- **Using a Private DNS:** My suggestion is using either [WARP](https://one.one.one.one/) or [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)
- **Using a VPN:** Free VPNs do not provide **enough privacy**, however [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) is an exception. You can use it comfortably.
- **Using an E-Mail Client:**. My suggestion is using [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/).
- **Using a 2FA (Two Factor Authenticator):** My suggestion is using [Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/), it is **open source and free**.
- **Using an Ad Blocker:** If you are using **Android**, I suggest you use [AdAway](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.adaway/). For your **web browser**, [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is the only viable option.
  - However if you are using a **Chromium based** browser such as Chrome, Edge, Arc etc. installing an ad blocker from **Google Web Store** will not work! You should either use [uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh) or a **Firefox based** browser for full functionality. For further information, visit [uBlock Origin Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/wiki/index/).
