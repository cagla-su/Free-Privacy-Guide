# Completely Free Privacy Guide
- Hello ü§≠. In this guide, you will be informed about **privacy** while using your **computer** or **mobile devices**.
- Nowadays, many companies such as **Microsoft** and **Google** collect **too much** personal information, so you might want to have more privacy while using your devices.
- For **100%** privacy, unfortunately you should either use one of your devices for hosting or pay for certain services.
  - What I mean by using a device for hosting can be using your own **e-mail domain** instead of using `@gmail.com, @outlook.com etc.` so your e-mails will be more secure and private
  - or using your own **unlimited and encrypted cloud storage etc.** This is a free way since you're hosting everything locally but you have to keep your device running all the time and not everyone has additional devices for hosting.
  - If you don't want to do local hosting, there are services that deliver **100% unlimited and private features** but they are paid.
- However, I will show you **completely free** ways for privacy. So, let's begin!
## For Computers
- For privacy on computers, I suggest you to use **Linux**. Linux distributions **respect your privacy** and they are **free**. Using computer for **daily use** is 100% possible on Linux, gaming is also possible (not 100%). So, if your concern about switching to Linux is it being not good enough for gaming, you can check my [Linux Gaming Guide](https://github.com/cutiepenguins/Linux-Gaming-Guide) to feel relieved.
- However, you might not want to get out of your comfort zone. In this case:
  - If you're using **MacOS**, you can apply basic steps like [explained in this article](https://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/en/resources/data_privacy/device-privacy-tips/How-Protect-Privacy-Mac.html).
  - If you're using **Windows**, you can use [Chris Titus' Windows Utility](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil), the utility also has cool features that increase performance.
## For Mobile Devices
- If you're using a device that has **iOS**, you can [follow this guide](https://github.com/iPrivacyGuides/iOS-Privacy-Guide)
- If you're using a device that has **Android**, I definitely suggest you to install a **custom ROM**. However if you don't want to install a custom ROM, you can [follow this guide](https://veepn.com/blog/10-android-privacy-settings/) basically and skip this step. If you will install a custom ROM, keep reading the step.
  - There are different kinds of custom roms. Those are:
    - `AOSP` - **Android Open Source Project :** This is the barebone android that Google shares the source code of. Those ROMs are generally lightweight. Some AOSP based ROM examples are:
      - `LineageOS`
      - `CrDroid`
      - `ArrowOS`
    - `CAF` - **Code Aurora Forum :** CAF ROMs are also **AOSP based** but they have specific optimizations for **Qualcomm devices (Snapdragon CPUs)** that deliver **smoothness, better performance, better RAM management** and **better battery life**. Some CAF based ROM examples are:
      - `Paranoid Android`
      - `ReloadedOS`
    - My personal suggestion is **CrDroid** since it is **not too barebone** that needs configuration and it has **highly customizable tools** and it has **some of the CAF optimizations**. Also from my personal experiences, my **Xiaomi Redmi Note 8** runs perfectly in terms of smooth performance and good battery life **only on CrDroid**. Also, CrDroid ROM **is maintained for lots of devices**. Assuming you installed CrDroid, let's continue.
    - CrDroid and all other **Vanilla** custom ROMs don't have **Google Play Services and Libraries** installed which means you are **unable** to use **location services, google play applications and push notifications**. That's why, I suggest you to use **MicroG**. You can check [my MicroG Guide](https://github.com/cutiepenguins/MicroG-Guide) if you're interested.
      - After installing MicroG, that's all you could do for an android experience with privacy.
## Other Methods (Regardless of Operating Systems)
- **Using a Private DNS:** My suggestions are using either [WARP](https://one.one.one.one/) or [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)
- **Using a VPN:** Free VPNs don't provide **enough privacy**, however [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) is an exception. You can use it comfortably.
- **Using an E-Mail Client:**. My suggestion is using [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/).
- **Using a 2FA (Two Factor Authenticator):** My suggestion is using [Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/), it is **open source and free**.
- **Using an Ad Blocker:** If you're using **Android**, I suggest you to use [AdAway](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.adaway/). For your **web browser**, [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is the only viable option.
  - However if you're using a **Chromium based** browser such as Chrome, Edge, Arc etc. installing an ad blocker from **Google Web Store** will not work! You should use a **Firefox based** browser for full functionality. For further information, visit [uBlock Origin Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/wiki/index/).
### Some Privacy Focused and/or Open Source Alternatives
- **Google Search Engine** `-` **DuckDuckGo**
- **Google Chrome** `-` **Firefox or any Firefox based browser. My suggestion is using Zen Browser**
- **Google Play Store** `-` **Aurora Store and F-Droid**
- **Gboard Keyboard** `-` **AOSP Keyboard** `but it can be hard to get used to AOSP keyboard, so you can keep using Gboard as it now lets you to stop sending telemetry to Google.`
- **Google Photos** `-` **Ente Photos**
- **Google Drive** `-` **MEGA**
- **Google Maps** `-` **Organic Maps** `but if you have issues with it (could be because you're in an unpopulous area), you can prefer Google Maps without logging in.`
- **Microsoft Office / WPS Office** `-` **OnlyOffice**
- **YouTube Android App** `-` **YouTube ReVanced**
- **Discord Desktop App** `-` **Vesktop**
